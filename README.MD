# Sprite Test (PS5)

This is a SDL2/C software test for jailbroken PS5 (3.xx-4xx).

## Prerequisites
- elfldr.elf
- shsrv.elf
- ftpsrv.elf

## How to Use
1. Send the elfldr.elf payload to port 9020.
2. Send the shsrv.elf payload to port 9021.
3. Send the ftpsrv.elf payload to port 9021.
4. Copy the sprites.elf payload and arial.ttf/icon.bmp to `/data` directory on your PS5.
5. Execute `telnet [PS5-IP] 2323`.
6. cd `/data`
6. Run the command `hbldr sprites.elf`.

## Rendering Limits
In tests on PS5 4.50, the sprite limit was 50,000 at 6.6fps. Above this, memory errors may occur.
